## Machine Learning for Real-Time Controls 

This repository provides basic Simulink Implementations of the following:

- Exact Model Knowledge (EMK)-based Controller (A1)
- Adaptive Controller with Parametric Uncertainity (A1)
- Single-Layer Learning-based Neural Network Controller (A2)
- Multi-Layer Learning-based NN-Controller (A2)
